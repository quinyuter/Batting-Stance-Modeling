# Batting-Stance-Modeling
Deep dive into where batters stand in the box and how that correlates with performance.

## Clustering
Based on the following new Statcast Batting Stance Statistics:
- Vertical Position
- Horizontal Postion
- Separation of Feet
- Batter Angle Direction
- Batting Side (Righty or Lefty)
I clustered the players. I will do a deep analysis about the similarities and differences between each cluster to see if where the batter stands in the box really makes a difference on performance.

### Notable Names for each Cluster
Initial findings show these names as part of each cluster. There are many more in each cluster, but these are just well known names. What do they have in common, if anything? Does it make sense that they are in the same cluster?

#### Cluster 0
- Pete Alonso
- Juan Soto
- Bryce Harper

#### Cluster 1
- Freddie Freeman
- Shohei Ohtani
- Mike Trout

#### Cluster 2
- Rafael Devers

#### Cluster 3

#### Cluster 4
